# FixCppWarnings
Clang-based rewriters (in python) for the more easily fixed issues diagnosed by gcc's `-Wall`. Understands C++98.

# Tips

 - Run on a linux machine where clang is present. That's most dev linux machines. 
 - The tricky part of using these scripts is supplying the appropriate compiler flags; namely all of the `-I`s and `-D`s clang needs to understand your code.
 - Any diagnostic of severity 3 or greater (error) is enough to mess up these scripts.
 - The output of each script is a file with the same name as the input file, but with an additional suffix `.rewrite`.

# Scripts

## fix-init-order.py
#### Purpose
This is for `-Wreorder`, when the compiler warns `"memberX will be initialized before memberY when initialized here..."`. That's telling you that the order of a class's members in the class definition is different than it is in a particular initializer list. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1828037/whats-the-point-of-g-wreorder . This script will reorder the initializers _in the constructor_.
#### Comments
Watch out for false edits using this script. It's a little tricky.

## remove-unused-parameters.py
#### Purpose
This is for `-Wunused-parameter`, when you give a name to a function parameter in the function's definition, but then don't use the variable in the function. This script will remove the _name_ (not the type) of the parameter in the function definition.
#### Comments
The whitepsace that previously surrounded any parameter name removed will remain; e.g. in
`int foo(int x, int y) { ... }` â†’ `int foo(int , int y) { ... }` if the parameter `x` is removed. 
Note the space remaining after the first `int`. I haven't yet thought of a safe way to remove that.

## add-trivial-switch-defaults.py
#### Purpose
This is for `-Wswitch`, when you have a `switch` on an `enum` type, and do not handle each of the possible `case`s, and don't have a `default` case. This script will add a `default: break;` to the end of the switch.
#### Comments
Adding a quiet `default` will make explicit what these warning-producing switches were doing implicitly already, but that does not mean it is the best solution. Review any modifications made by this script and see whether a `default` case is appropriate for your switches.
